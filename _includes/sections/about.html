<h1>About</span></h1>

    I make maps and do worldbuilding in a fairly disjointed and chaotic manner. If you can bear it, I hope you like this blog. I can't promise I won't talk about films, books, and other media too, though.

    If you want to talk with me, you're welcome to do so via e-mail, Twitter, and Telegram.
