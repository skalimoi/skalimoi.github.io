<h1>About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am known by many names, that's the way it is. However, my pseudonyms are Skalwell and Skalimoi. I make maps and do worldbuilding in a fairly disjointed and chaotic manner. If you can bear it, I hope you like this blog. I can't promise I won't talk about films, books, and other media too, though.

    If you have questions or you just want to talk with me, you're welcome to do so via e-mail, Twitter, and Telegram.
