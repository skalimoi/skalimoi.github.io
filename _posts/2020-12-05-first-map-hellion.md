Hello, everyone. This is going to be the first map in what consists of a *very* ambitious series of maps and texts that will, little by little, flesh out and describe the world of the *Sl√©tti Dythen*. All these pages will be part of a yet unnamed atlas. Right now, I have thought about developing the following sections:

- General maps of regions and countries (like this one).
- Another map for the same region, but political instead of topographical.
- A page or two containing information and data about whatever region has been depicted.

I'm thinking about writing other pages that talk about interesting elements of the world as a whole, like concepts, chronologies... I would need to see if it would work out. Meanwhile, I have enough work with what I explained.

Honestly, it's the first time I make a whole map just with Illustrator, and it's been both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's incredibly easy and versatile on the long run to make an entirely vectorial map. You don't need to worry about quality or size! On the other hand, though, it can be more consuming in terms of time and resources. If I had a coin for every time Illustrator has crashed... However, I would still recommend it. There are other alternatives that are either free or cheap, like Inkscape or Affinity Designer, but you know what? Just download a pirated version of Illustrator and you'll be fine.

For the terrain, I already had a heightmap (or DEM) of Hellion, which is a grayscale image that depicts the elevation, so I only had to import it into ArcGis Pro to calculate the different contour lines. If you're familiar with GIS software, this is pretty easy to do: easier if you use ArcGis Pro... but it's a commercial software. I couldn't crack it this time, so I went and created a Student account so I could use it for free. 

You could ask me: why don't you use open-source software like QGIS? I mean, QGIS is a great software and I use it for other purposes, but it isn't capable of calculating contour polygons, only contour lines. The difference between these is that contour polygons are stacked up, so they don't create conflicts between each other: they go one above the other. If you try to fill contour lines with color, you'll have a lot of problems because they're all at the same level.

I choose Hellion to be the first depicted region because it's the country I have the most information of. It's the setting of the story I plan to write (Hah! I almost sound like a real writer here), an isolated country in the limits of the Pole of Ancroma on the south. You can already imagine: it's a pretty cold region, hostile and lacking, but still a living place full of wonders and beautiful landscapes. It's a very important place to me: even if it's far from perfect (you *really* wouldn't like to live there), it's still my spiritual home. You'll know more about it in the future.

If you're interested, once I make some more maps I'll write a quick guide about the overall process of mapmaking. Any feedback, questions and comments on what I post would make me very happy.

Oh, and a final note:

All my posts will be written in English. There will be some that will have an alternative Spanish version: written texts and so on. Maybe I'll switch to a full bilingual format in the future, but it will work like this in the meantime.
