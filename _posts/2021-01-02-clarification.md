Happy new year to all of you. 

Perhaps you expected this blog to have more content, and I feel deeply sorry if it's that way, but I'm afraid I'm not the type of person who has a big output of work. I make things when I have time, and sometimes I spend a lot of time just to complete something I started a long time ago. Just know that this website won't be abandoned at all... Just existing until I upload something new. So I'll just post when I have something to show. 

Usually, I have something new to offer every month or two, sometimes three. The truth is that these last months haven't been the best for me, so I'm trying not to push myself too much. Creative hobbies should be enjoyable, not a chore of any kind. I've had a lot of problems with that, as many artists and hobbyists do. However, I've found solace on planning a D&D campaign with my friends, so I guess that's a wonderful excuse to make new things, at least for me. 

A teaser for the next post: an essay on the nature of worldbuilding. Stay updated, and have a pleasant day!
