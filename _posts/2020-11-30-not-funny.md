***When I still remembered what made me unique.***

What did you feel, my friends? The frozen breeze of the grey ocean on your faces, tanning the skin to dust. I can't even imagine... For although I was with you that cold morning and sank my feet into that same sand, nothing of what I felt that day can compare to your memories. Ungrateful, you all. Some cry and others curse. Egas rejoices by scratching their teeth.

I observe you all from afar. I always suspected this would happen. The mistake was not having expected it sooner.

You, trekker of the mountains, what did you think then, when you knelt down and raised your hands to embrace the sun? I'm sure you didn't even notice the increasing humidity of your knees over the sea. Eyes and burning hearts overflow. I can almost taste the salty furrows on your cheeks.

And you, bride of the wandering wind, how can you justify such an atrocity? You walk away from them, never to return. Spear on belt, emaciated boots without half your toes. You always imagine your destiny in pastel colours, but you never thought it would be starry black. I cry over you so that your sky will be clear. Your future is beyond the river, far from the scorched earth. Not here.

Goodbye.

Why are you laughing? It's not funny. Egas is sitting there, chewing the bark of the boat while their right eye looks at the sky and their left eye at the ground. Their sharp teeth are like stones that keep crashing into each other to make fire. And their laugh? Their laugh is the omen. Good or bad, it is impossible to know, but something always happens when they laughs. The permanent percussion accustoms my ears not to take silence for granted. Egas, you bastard, I couldn't have wished for a worse companion for the journey of our lives! Your laughter also occupied my thoughts the day they threw away our old statues to build a prison, a geometrical and shiny prison on the banks of the river Num. Inside, there were only innocents.

I wonder if it should have affected us. I didn't feel anything the day they threw away my last statue. What a thought! I don't even know. Maybe I should have dared to feel something new on such a special day. I dreamt of that moment as much as I wished I could die: so strong, so intense. I finally realised that my last sacred temple on the land of men had been corrupted by people of the worst kind. Those I once trusted and asked for nothing in return. How sad. Play a dirge not for me but for them, for they are all lost and I can do nothing to save them.

It was like a fleeting vision out of the corner of my hundred eyes. I would even say that I felt the fingers of memory touch the tip of my feathers with a disconcerting softness. I now think that this affection was our desire to be able to understand, at last, and to stop torturing for something that I didn't even know was inside us. This planet, this earth, is not mine. Neither are they yours. I have spent so much time searching its nooks and crannies and studying all that it has to offer, and for what? To understand it. Because I don't understand anything.

That's right. Allow me to accept that I don't understand and I have never understood anything that happens in this withered world. Not even the far-reaching minds of my brothers will, let alone yours. Oh, it hurts so much to say this, it's a poisoned thorn! I am the keeper of wisdom! That which they destroy, I protect! This truth is carved in my feathers, lying in my heart. Not even the most lousy structure of mortality is ready to be understood. 

On the second day of my eternal birth, a servant of Time confessed it to me in a dry whisper: 

"There is no truth other than ignorance."

Seven words like seven stars burning the skin. Every word they uttered, a wing of them was took away. they ended up drowned in their own blood. Dense as jam. I think they wanted to die.

Stop laughing. It's not funny.
